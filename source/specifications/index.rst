Packaging Specifications
========================

Below are the current and authoritative specifications for the various facets of
Python Packaging. These specifications represent the final product of the PEP
process, as it applies to the domain of Python Packaging.

As Packaging PEPs are approved, a corresponding adjustment is made to
appropriate specifications below, and the PEP History section is updated for
each with an explanation of the change.

In special cases, adjustments can made to these specifications outside of the
PEP process, but only for the purpose of clarifying the intended meaning.

Each specification will maintain an Implementation section that covers if and
when the various Python packaging tools and systems began supporting the
specification.
